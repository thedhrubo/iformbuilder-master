# Iformbuilder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0.

## Development server

In this git version, node module did not upload. So to set up this project, you need to do the following steps :

in the command prompt, go to the directory of the project.

run 'npm update'
It will take a few minutes and download necessary files for the node modules. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The api is in live server so that the project can communicate perfectly. 

The api is set up at this link : http://fouraxiz.com/iformbuilder/index.php

I also uploaded the php class file. Those are in the api folder.

And the form information is saving in the following account :

url : https://app.iformbuilder.com/exzact/dataViews.php

username : the.dhrubo@gmail.com
password : Dhrubo_123456

Now if you open the form id : 3715842 form name : Registration Form, you will be able to see that, from the angular the form information is saving with using the access token and the corresponding api.

Please let me know if you have any question.
I will be available at : 
email : the.dhrubo@gmail.com

Thanks
